# NEJM-Covid
This project is based on a publication in the NEJM (2020). False negative tests for SARS-Co-2 Infection â€“ Challenges and Implications.
Steven Woloshin, M.D., Neeraj Patel, B.A., and Aaron S. Kesselheim, M.D., J.D., M.P.H. NEJM 383:6 august 6, 2020 .
We reproduced all plots in the paper by using the data provided using the R a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

#### Conclusion
In the final part of the paper the authors draw several conclusions with regards to the safety of the test, the obligations of manufacturers to provide details of the test in terms of clinical sensitivity and specificity, the problems with false negative results in the general population where pretest probability of disease is much lower than in the hospital environment and they stress the importance of defining thresholds for ruling out infection for a variety of clinical situations.
However, they did not discuss the problems that arise with fals positive test results in the general population to get a complete picture of reality based on the data provided.
In this R project we supply the additional data to get the complete picture.

#### NEJM-Covid-master.zip

In theNEJM-Covid-master.zip file, you will find 1 folder:  R-Code folder and a README.md file.

#### Create a new folder on your computer

Put the .r files in this new folder. Start your RStudio with a **new project in this folder** and you are done. In the right lower corner of your Rstudio openingspage you will find under the **Files** tab all .r files that you can import to your project.You also find the datasets used in this project.
